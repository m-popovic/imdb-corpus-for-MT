This is the biggest Flop of 2008.
I don know what Director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster.
The songs have been added without situations, the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people.
Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish... Akki is also done a good job....
But the movieee just forget it.
Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (as Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is puzzled when a courtroom defendant whispers "Thank you" to testifying officer LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) as he leaves the witness stand.
In the opening sequences of this film, you are given the explanation.
You will see Mr. Cool J's devilish detective partner Dylan McDermott (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decide NOT to murder Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles).
The cops in the city of "Edison" are so corrupt they shoot their suspects, steal their money, and snort their dope.
Whether he's out to impress his girlfriend (herein, called "Pussy") or win a Pulitzer, the city's corruption does NOT sit well with the noble Mr. Timberlake.
Timberlake decides to investigate the corruption, which reaches both unexpected scope and life-threatening levels of danger.
Writer/director David J. Burke keeps the film above water, but just barely.
LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the "pop star to movie star" sweepstakes (aka the "rapper to actor" progression).
Mr. McDermott has fun with his role.
Lending gravitas to the proceedings are sagely supporting actors Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (as Levon Wallace).
F.R.A.T. means First Response Assault and Tactical, but it's more important to know that "Edison (Force)" stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems lost).
**** Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
All the world said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case.
Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress Kareena Kapoor.
She was unbearable throughout the film.
Her tom-boy look does not really goes well.
Even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all.
Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay but its not at all Quetin.
The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie.
Anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not.
Akshay Kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is Saif.
The Style and the Phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed
I wasn't terribly impressed with Dante's 1st season offering in "Homecoming", it wasn't much of a horror story, but rather a smart political statement with the undead.
Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men's sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women.
The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists.
Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home.
I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak, but is unclear because this is never revisited.
The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah.
It seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end.
The worst episode.
Well, except for chocolate.
I've now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes, and this is among the worst.
An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll.
If watching people things they never would in real life amuses you ("let's check out the basement!"), then this is your show.
Except, it's not amusing or entertaining - it's just annoying.
The extent of the virus is never, ever showed.
I can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only, as the resulting situation is very, very frightening.
But then things deteriorate as daughter lets OBVIOUSLY deranged dad into the home, and ultimately dies at his hands.
The woman flees north, and runs into a few tens situations.
Then, some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her (things that make you go HUH?).
Or something.
Then, she is huddling for warmth.
The end - awful.
These directors are mailing this tripe in.
Masters of Horror: The Screwfly Solution starts as America is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population, when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of God.
Scientist Alan (Jasn Priestley) is brought in by the Government & knows more than most & senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife Anne (Kerry Norton) to take their teenage daughter Amy (Brenna O'Brien) & try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them...
This Canadian American co-production was episode 7 from season 2 of the Masters of Horrror TV series, directed by Joe Dante I thought The Screwfly Solution was pretty bad.
I personally think the script by Sam Hamm sucks, it takes itself far too seriously & I don't really understand why it's part of the Masters of Horror series, the horror that the filmmakers are going for in The Screwfly Solution is in the actual story itself & themes & ideas it brings up rather than on screen. 
I wasn't happy with the inconsistencies with the story either, if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that woman's neck on the plane?
Was he sexually aroused, I think not.
Why does every bloke then think he's killing in the name of God?
I just can't see every single bloke on Earth suddenly knowing the Bible & starting to believe in God, I just found the notion ridiculous & the show also states clearly that there's nothing religious about what's going on so what's the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see?
Then there's the fact people get turned on by different things, what about gays for instance?
Will they kill guys instead of women?
I know there's a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it's conveniently brushed to one side & then there's the thing which annoyed me the most.
The fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho & killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened, it just felt so stupid, the plotting is rubbish & to round things off there's a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of The X-Files (1993 - 2002) with a bright neon alien.
Director Dante on this showing definitely doesn't qualify as a Master of Horror as far a I'm concerned, the story is badly paced, it's just so stupid considering it's played deadly straight & instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it's deadly virus on the loose situation & the subsequent mother & daughter on the run because of it, there's very little here in the way of what I would call effective horror & even less gore.
There's a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle, a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle & another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about.
Technically like the other episodes it's really good & it doesn't have the look of a cheap TV series, the special effects are great as usual & it's well made.
The acting is alright but no-one really stood out.
The Screwfly Solution is easily the worst Masters of Horror episode I've seen but bear in mind I haven't seen all of them... yet.
As a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me & as a show made by a so-called Master of Horror it disappoints me even more.
I love the frequently misnomered "Masters of Horror" series.
Horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment.
Projects like this (and the similar "Greenlight Project" with gave us "Feast" - like it or lump it) are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror.
This one began with a kernel of really-kool-idea and ran ... right off the edge of "where in the world am I going with this?!!!
".I don't know how  o spoil the spoiled but "SPOILER AHEAD" All of a sudden ... no, there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier ... we have long haired luminescent aliens (huh?... HUH?) brain drilling males and ... yeah, I get it but ... well ... the worst curse of storytelling - a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement.
Cue to storytellers ... your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up.
Not the other way around.
Storytelling math 101.
End of Spoilers - Big Oops!
A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante.
Their previous collaboration on the first season's "Homecoming" was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways.
This poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered.
The supposed "payoff" showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing.
If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial "cleaning" of the planet of it's human infestation, why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion?
Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la Stephen King's "The Stand" instead of having the male population butcher the females?
I kept hoping the episode would improve as I kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous.
The religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear Sam Hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it.
I like a lot of both Dante and Hamm's work but this was just unwatchable.
I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned.
From the domestic violence, to sexuality and many of the taboos therein.
Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fiction.
It's bleak, depressing and hopeless.
While I don't mind a less than cheery ending, I'm really very tired of the "humans suck" cliché that's central to every movie.
I know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how's 'bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil!
Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim 'til your arms are tired.
This way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive.
It's silly, not thoughtful, and boring.
Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced, economical and very entertaining.
I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life.
This is one of Warner's few hard-edged melodramas that simply doesn't work.
Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20-year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences.
Robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don't cut the mustard.
H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad acting of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie.
Starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie.
In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code Hollywood.
LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations.
Sol Polito's camera work is strong.
Somehow, this piece of dreck got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (in a year that gave us "M," "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
A little girl's dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification.
When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed to be the body of a couple's missing daughter.
After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence.
All of this changes when one day, many years later, she receives a phone call from her daughter!
With the help of an ex-cop and a reporter, she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive.
"Los Sin Nombre" is a mess plot-wise, moves at an achingly slow pace, and is completely unscary.
The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother.
The best part of the movie is the ending, but I'm not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film.
Beware of the English subtitles on the recent R1 release--they aren't very accurate.
When you go at an open air cinema under the Greek summer night you usually don't care what the movie is!
Edison started really good with some good effort from the singers-who-want-to-be actors and a once again great Morgan Freeman but... (In a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience,done, a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action ,done, and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie...) when you see 30 elite police officers (packed with weapons that can demolish a building) shoot at a guy behind a car, fail to hit him even once while he kills all (but 3) and then the guy takes out a flame thrower (to kill the rest 3) ,you realise that the Greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this!
I'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a film that Richard Donner executed masterfully.
I am also not alone in scorning Richard Lester's Superman 2... which brings us to the Richard Donner cut of the same movie, sadly it is still an absolute abomination.
Superman's world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses, but Superman 2 stretches things too far.
It doesn't matter who directed Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader.
In a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do, unlike the original superman.
With or without his powers, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) is handled in the least believable manner.
There is too much to criticize, so I will not bother.
I condemn this movie... perhaps the slapstick in the Lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on.
Super-Duper bad.
I grew up on the 'Superman II' theatrical version ("S2T") and as a kid, I loved it more than Part I since not only did it contain more Superman and three Superman-type villains, it started off with a bang the best Clark Kent to Superman transformations and rescue scenes.
Kids no longer had to impatiently wait for Superman to appear on screen, as in part I.
Now as an adult, I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T (See: my review.)
I've always heard of the back-story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original's director, Richard Donner from part II.
(It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously, now it's common: 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2 & 3 for example.)
Unfortunately, after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut (or, "S2RD") I still can't fully recommend it.
Gone, was the great Superman change scene, the entire Paris rescue, as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2T's opening.
In fact, they all but wrote the words: "Previously on Superman" in S2RD.
The special effects weren't great in either Part I or S2T , but S2RD, they were mostly downright laughable such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window.
I will admit, some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures, such as any scene in the "honeymoon suite."
Overall, if you grew up on S2T as I did, and loved it as a child not nitpicking as I do as an adult, you should absolutely see S2RD as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes.
(Spoiler alert) Unfortunately, the worst change comes last: gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with the exact same ending as 'I.'
This is not only a lazy, unoriginal copout, it doesn't make sense on why Clark would go back to that diner, if those events never actually happened.
And will he continue to "turn back time" for every confrontation?
So...we get so see added footage of Brando...interesting but not exactly Oscar worthy stuff.
Susannah York was hardly a slouch.
New scene where Lois finds out Clark is Superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets.
Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that...let's listen to Donner make fun of Lester's version that made more logical sense.
The president talks of the Zod "defacing" the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore.
Tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd.
Superman's "freedom of the press" line sounded silly compared to "..Care to step outside" which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to Clark's earlier scene in the truck stop.
Then there is the ending with the "turn back the world to go back in time" effect.
It turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for Hackensack, N.J. ever went since it doesn't free Zod and company any more.
Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut should be a fan's dream come true.
At long last, footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life.
A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored.
It seems like a winning situation.
And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this "esoteric dream" is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence.
While it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project.
And it is only a very few times.
You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics.
But then we start seeing new footage (alternates from Superman - The Movie for the trial) and that first bit of hesitation fades away.
Hey, this is pretty neat!
Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project, and it doesn't convince at all.
And from this point on, it never ever lets up.
It's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects, but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was "You'll Believe A Man Can Fly" it's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here.
The best effects in this are from the original productions.
Another issue with this re-cut.
A lot of it just doesn't make sense.
The only reason any of it really works is because we've all seen the theatrical version of Superman II, a movie that does make sense.
Lester's Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly.
Part of this could be because Donner didn't get to complete shooting, the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible.
What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.
After viewing this, one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material, Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester.
The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II.
That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence, not ironically, both were filmed by Donner.
But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is re-edited in such a hasty fashion, that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing.
While Lester honored the Donner material, Lester here is thrown under the bus.
So is there anything good in this release?
Well Marlon Brando is in it, and that's neat to see.
In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman - The Movie.
But that only highlights the problems of this release.
Any of the major scenes (really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando) would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section.
Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances (many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used) sloppy edits and bad decisions.
Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet.
Why are we looking at Jackie Cooper's back as he calls for Lois and Clark?
At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on?
I was initially confused by this, because I expected to see Lois.
The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.
Battle scenes are a mess too, with no geography between cuts.
It's just random action.
Of course, the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates.
They should have used more of Lester's footage, but probably had too much pride to admit that.
The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well.
As noted elsewhere, the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation "XK 10" while we all know it's the "XK 101"!
A blind man in STM knows that!
The producers of this assembly, who tried so hard to honor the original film, dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production.
For all the supposed care that was put into this, the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.
The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warner's didn't make this a separate release here in the states.
As it is, we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a "Play All" option.
It's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes, but after that initial viewing, I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else.
I know after my experience of watching this, I had new respect for Lester's version.
It's by no means perfect, but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief.
He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so, while this new re-cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history.
I was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was.
Was the viewer supposed to learn something, or reflect on anything here?
What was up with the pumpkins?
Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots?
Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel?
Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery).
The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished.
I am truly amazed.
I believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community.
