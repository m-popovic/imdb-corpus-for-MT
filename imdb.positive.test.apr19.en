I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie!
Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.
I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!
I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.
As for those that think that this film is "overrated" or "over-hyped"...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that!
lol* You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film "HUGE" or a "HIT" with the general movie-going public.
PEOPLE make the film a huge success.
With Titanic, everyone was in awe.
Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before.
At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking.
This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912.
Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!
Give this movie a break you guys!
The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!
When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!
So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was "overhyped"...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being "overhyped".
ha! Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.
However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!
Personally, I LOVE this film.
However, this film might not be for everyone.
DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though!
THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard!
Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!
The story was sweet.
The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it... the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate... it was that GIGANTIC Ship!
I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job.
It's not thier best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before.
Give them a break!
I avoided watching this film for the longest time.
Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it.
I never watched it in the theatre.
I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it.
Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest.
One of the girls spoke about this movie.
"It was so great," she said.
"You really felt like you were on the ship."
"Nonsense," I thought.
I shared my feelings with my fellow judges.
One looked at me and said, "you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic.
The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."
"Well, maybe," thought I.
Then it finally appeared on Pay TV.
"OK," I thought, "I'll give it a look see."
I didn't want to like it - and I didn't.
I loved it!
What a great movie.
Where to start?
First - the directing.
My high school public speaking contestant was right.
James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost "you are there" type of atmosphere.
The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world.
The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic.
You don't just watch it; you really do feel it.
Then - the performances.
The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good.
They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect "t" I thought.
In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother.
She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack.
Then - the details.
I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance.
Very impressive, indeed.
Then - the song.
Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of "My Heart Goes On."
Problems.
Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class.
(I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.)
The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.
A minor quibble, though.
This is truly an excellent movie.
My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive. 9/10
To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it?
IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss.
The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think.
I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book.
It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night.
It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.
I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on.
Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money!
How lame is that?
It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.
I will gladly side with the majority this time around.
Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.
After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted, urban, turn of the century Australian street, we meet Julie (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam) as they go out house hunting.
They manage to get a loan for a fixer-upper on a posh Sydney street, but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home.
It just may be haunted.
13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clich√©d story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker.
The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget, but not wholly excusable to that hurdle.
A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film.
The opening "thriller scene" features some wonky editing.
Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that there's not much action.
Suspense should be created from staging, not fancy "fix it in the mix" techniques.
There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location, the lighting, the fog and such, but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim, cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street, showing their increasing proximity.
The tracking and the cuts need to be slow.
The attack needed to be longer, clearer and better blocked.
As it stands, the scene has a strong "made for television" feel, and a low budget one at that.
After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves.
The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror (1979), though the budget forces a much subtler approach.
Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios, often dramatic in nature instead of special effects-oriented, such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron, which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.
For some horror fans, the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama.
At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in.
But Morphett writes fine, intelligent dialogue.
The material is done well enough that it's often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise later--especially if you've gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.
Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder, even though the special effects often leave much to be desired, the ideas are good.
The performances help create tension.
There isn't an abundance of death and destruction in the film--there's more of an abundance of home repair nightmares.
But neither menace is really the point.
The point is human relationships.
There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting.
The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it.
That it's in a posh neighborhood, and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies, shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe, such as money or health problems.
Peter's character evolves from a striving corporate employee with "normal" work-based friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive, scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful.
At the same time, we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be.
Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown, but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.
Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its made-for-television clunkiness, as a TV movie, this is a pretty good one, with admirable ambitions.
Anyone fond of haunted house films, psycho films or horror/thrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy.
It certainly isn't worth spending $30 for a DVD (that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it (factoring in shipping and handling)), but it's worth a rental, and it's definitely worth watching for free.
Every once in a while the conversation will turn to "favorite movies."
I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker.
I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie.
And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.
I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time.
Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years.
I cried again.... in all the same places.
It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time.
A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars).
And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it.
Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film.
You look like an out of touch cynic.
No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults.
Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly.
However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful.
Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation.
Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy.
Kate Winslet was so strong in this film.
The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.
James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic.
The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night.
How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me.
I was utterly transfixed.
This film is one memorable scene after another.
Titanic leaving port in Southampton.
Rose and Jack at the bow, "flying".
"Iceberg, right ahead!"
The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean.
The screams of the doomed after she went down.
And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.
The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient.
James Horner's score was simply perfect.
And the love theme was beautiful and tragic.
Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.
I confess, I am a Titanic buff.
As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty.
Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life.
However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs.
I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy.
The film was made with such humanity.
Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.
I am not a parent, neither am I a male.
But I was able to identify with every character's heartaches and pains.
This is a movie teenagers should watch.
Maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again.
I'm sorry for those that don't understand the value of love, family and friendship.
It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than that of Bobby Ewing.
And it is great to see a 19 year old Ben Affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance.
He showed at an early age, that he is capable of heartfelt drama.
He should be offered more serious roles.
Note Hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006.
This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages.
Maybe shouldn't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families, but I recommend it to the entire family.
I bought this movie on DVD and have watched it with friends many times.
Because it portrays the values that are important in life.
Daniell Steel's Daddy, what a refreshing story.
This movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children.
How rare is that?
In these times of "Heather has two Mommies" (or what ever, you fill in the blanks) it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone.
With the father's roles being prominent I was hoping this would be another Daniell Steel Saga.
How disappointing to have it end.
Every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role.
I would have loved to see each character develop over the years.
I loved this movie, it is one I will defiantly watch every time it's on.
Good story, good acting, and I hope this isn't a spoiler, but no obtrusive sex or bad language.
Yes it touched my heart.
Warning, get the Kleenex ready.
What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment, be it Television or Movie's.
Daniell if your listening, You Go Girl, give us more.
Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage.
He's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed.
By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.
Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it.
It basically steals the name, mocks politics of the book (which is a good portion of it), and throws in some T&A so the average idiot American moviegoer doesn't get bored.
This anime isn't perfect, but it's at least mostly accurate, as best I can tell.
Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about.
Love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about.
One man, Daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity.
The kids grow up,one all be it, in the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is, the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall.
ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances.
Yes, I shed a tear along the way knowing I had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent.
This true to life is one which every young adult, and parent, would do well to see, although some will not realize it until they too are parents.
A must see for those who care about their families.
It's heart-warming to see a movie that doesn't bash males.
In this one the wife/mother leaves her family to "get in touch" with herself - or pursue her libido.
The father stays with and nurtures the kids, letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them.
I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance" I was a little bit skeptical.
"Steamy"?
In a movie from 1968??
I was prepared for disappointment.
And when I realized it was shot entirely in black & white, I knew my erotic hopes were dashed.
Boy, was I wrong!
Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love, fear of the secret being found out, a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic.
You will soon forget that it is shot in black & white.
The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years.
And the performances from the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable.
OK, so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls.
It's 1968.
Do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this?
Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then.
Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.
I think this movie was way ahead of its time.
The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.
I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here.
As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action: Although it won't be all you expect, I don't think you'll be too, too disappointed.
This is a film.., not porn.
This is a wonderful film!!!
Full of tender moments and memories!!
A beautiful piece of work!!!
Excellent!!!
For intelligent, viewers only!!
If you are a film lover.
A romantic.
A person who has loved deeply, this is your film!!!
It has a beautiful surreal quality.
Fine acting and directing.
Watching this film made me remember my first love.
Thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life, love and the meaning of loss.
Highly recommended for all film lovers.
It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact
Even by today's standards, the film is interesting and provocative
Therese and Isabelle are both attending the same girl's school 
Therese is energetic, intelligent, and becomes a mentor for the innocent, naive, sweet Isabelle
She guides her through a number of exotic experiences, including a trip through an exclusive brothel, into her first lesbian liaison, and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience
The film does not exploit any sex, nor is there an abundance of nudity...
The imagery is effective, but sometimes the camera lingers too long, and the story goes slowly
The director, Radley Metzger, went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of Henry Paris
He always has extremely detailed stories, good acting, and very high standards of cinematography...Artistically, however, this is perhaps his most complete
His later attempts supplied for entertainment, whereas "Therese and Isabelle" was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism...
We watched this in my Women's Health Issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies, and I absolutely loved this movie.
I plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch.
The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone.
I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed.
This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating.
This is a movie I will show to my children.
The professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women, but this movie was more than that.
It is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite.
I was going to bed with my gf last night, and while she was brushing her teeth, I flipped channels until I came across this Chinese movie called the King of Masks.
At first I thought it was going to be a Kung Fu movie, so I started watching it, and then it immediately captured me in, and I had to finish it.
The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble.
She was such a great actor for being so little.
Maybe the fact it was in Chinese, so the English was dubbed made it harder for me to tell...but she really seemed to be in character perfectly.
I felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her "boss" but everything just turned out rotten.
Even when she brings him another grandson, just so he can pass on his art...it turns out that kid was kidnapped, so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live.
lol...whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa, just backfires.
In the end, he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks...which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.
Definitely a gem, and totally original. Scott
I admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of his/her reluctant guardian.
I've seen enough of them -- Baby Boom, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent, Whale Rider -- to expect to be bored by the formula.
What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting: small-town China in the 1930's.
Extreme poverty was the norm, and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market.
When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he's nicknamed "Doggie," is a granddaughter, he initially casts her out, even though she's showed great promise as street-performing heir.
Even after he reluctantly takes her back, he's not too upset when she's kidnapped.
The film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, street-smart girl had to go to survive in that society.
The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context.
In a Western society, one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success.
Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that I did, too.
While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage.
And after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her, her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense.
The peek at small-town life in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two lead actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.
